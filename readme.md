InspirePay currently works with USD only.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get an InspirePay account? =

InspirePay accounts can be setup at http://inspirepay.com/.  They are free.

= What should I put in "InspirePay URL Slug" in the widget settings?=

Your unique URL slug.  Mine is 'mark' since my InspirePay page is https://inspirepay.com/pay/mark

= What are the shortcodes? =

[inspirepay_donation inspirepay_url="mark"] 

Where "inspirepay_url" is your account name... Mine is "mark" which I just stated above, but if you'd like your website to send donations to me, that would be ok... just use mark.  Otherwise use you. 

Other variables are: "submit_button_text" and "donation_amount" 

In this case: [inspirepay_donation inspirepay_url="mark" submit_button_text="Donate A Slice Of Pizza" donation_amount="9.95"] 

Creates a form with a default amount of $9.95 (although this is a donation FORM, so the amount can be edited), with a button that reads, "Donate A Slice Of Pizza." 

If you want a fixed dollar amount, than a link is easier to build... 

<a href="https://inspirepay.com/pay/mark/$9.95">Donate A Slice Of Pizza</a>
